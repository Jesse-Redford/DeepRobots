## Contributors

## Dependencies
- Python: â‰¥ 3.6
- Keras
- matplotlib

## Directories
- make sure to create the directory `Trials` under DeepRobots directory so that results can be saved properly
- `DiscreteRL`: different versions of implementation of discrete RL agent
- `DQN`: most up-to-date implementation of DQN agent
    - `DQN_agent.py`: a general-purpose class that can be easily used to train different kinds of snake robots. 
    See `DQN_swimming_runner.py` and `DQN_wheeled_runner.py` for examples
- `DQN_old`: some old implementation of DQN, please ignore
- `Mathematica Notebooks`: used for generating animation and plots
- `Robots`: different types of snake robot models.
    - `DiscreteDeepRobots.py`, `ContinuousDeepRobot.py`: wheeled snake robot implementation
    - `ContinuousSwimmingBot.py`: swimming snake robot implementation

## Quick Start Guide

Make sure the system path is set up properly so that all library and module imports can be successfully performed. 
See `DQN_swimmimming_runner.py` for example.

```bash
cd DeepRobots
python DQN/DQN_swimming_runner.py
```
