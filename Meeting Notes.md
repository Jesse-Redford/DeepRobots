# DeepRobots Research Meeting Notes

---
## 11/30

- next time
    - fix DeepRobots implementation
    - ask Tony for Mathematica inputs and outputs
    - compare with Python model
- questions:
    - openAI (don't worry)
    - how to keep the continuity Scott mentioned (don't worry)
    - this implementation is only for proximal link, do we need other links? (implement the function)
    - do I need to integrate over theta_dot? Is it already given by x and y dot? (No)
    - when the input is pi/3, pi/3, D becomes 0 (singularity)
    - self.state is broken (another version of implementation) 
    - plot graph with matplotlib (noted)
